			<td><h5><center>The Netflix show Never Have I Ever has been praised for its coming-of-age storytelling and comedic elements. The show, which is loosely based on creator Mindy Kaling's own childhood experiences, follows teenager Devi Vishwakumar. After the loss of her father, Devi loses the use of her legs for three months and returns to high school determined to change her social status.</center></h5></td>

		<tr class="table-warning">
			<td><h5><center>In season one, we’re introduced to Devi, a high school sophomore struggling to find herself in the wake of her father’s sudden death. She lives outside Los Angeles with her overbearing — but loving — mother Nalini (Poorna Jagannathan), and older cousin, Kamala (Richa Moorjani). At the start of the new school year, Devi is determined that she and her besties, Eleanor (Ramona Young) and Fabiola (Lee Rodriguez), climb the Sherman Oaks social ladder. The first step is finding a boyfriend, so she sets her sights on the ultra-popular upperclassman Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet). Throughout the season, Devi makes her fair share of mistakes — which leads to a “friendship breakup” between her and Eleanor and Fab, a big argument with her mother about not wanting to move to India, and an awkward up-and-down relationship with Paxton. All the while, she continues to butt heads with her frenemy, Ben (Jaren Lewison). But by the season one finale, Devi has healed her relationships with Eleanor, Fabiola, and her mother — and just as Paxton seems to realize that Devi is the one for him and calls to tell her, Devi and Ben kiss.

The finale ends on this cliffhanger, establishing the Devi-Paxton-Ben love triangle for season 2.</center></h5></td>
